# Petrophysical Rock Properties Prediction-ML

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting petrophysical properties of rocks using supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. The project is primarily contained in the Jupyter Notebook titled "Petrophysical__Rock_Properties_Prediction_ML.ipynb". It demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning techniques in the field of geology and petrophysics.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Detailed analysis and exploration of the dataset, including statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques applied to process and transform raw data into features suitable for machine learning models.
- **Model Development:** Implementation and tuning of various machine learning algorithms to find the most effective model for predicting rock properties.
- **Evaluation:** Methods used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, including metrics and validation strategies.
- **Visualization:** Advanced visualization techniques to represent the findings, model performance, and predictions.
